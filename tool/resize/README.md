# resize

this is a PoC for 

 - manually expand and make compound path, without vector editing programs.
 - scale svg to desired viewBox / size 

it doesn't correctly handle SVG with elements other than path (check comments inside) so we will have to tweak it in order to integrate it into the build process.
